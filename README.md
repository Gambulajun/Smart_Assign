Flaws

Delete:
While deleting
1>When there is already 1 entry of that emp in some other audit 
Delete option not working(it should delete the current row of current audit dates)
and keep the prev audit data and booking as it is
2>When we go to new audit book emp 1 then emp 2 emp 3
Emp 2 and 3 I am able to delete but emp 1 in all audit is not deleting

Clash:
Working just show a pop up that clash detected

Booking:
1>Wont book till you enter both date
2>Second date should be ahead of 1st date
3>When booked show booking registered

Clear button not working:
It should delete all the entries of that particular audit 

When submitting and deleting(if it is at 5th page then it goes back to 1st page of emp)
(keep it at 5th page of emp)
